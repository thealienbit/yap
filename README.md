Yet Another Password?

A developer-centric zero knowledge password manager so that you don't have to remember ***yet another password***


If you are like me who uses multiple devices, often multiple OSs' and a new browser on a random day and is not satisfied with the current password managers where you either have to face vendor lock in (google/apple) or trust a third party app to store your passwords securely. This might be a perfect solution for you.
